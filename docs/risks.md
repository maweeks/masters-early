# Risk Assessment

| Risk | Possible Consequences | Probability | Severity | Overall Risk | Preventative Measures |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Twitter disables public access to their API and data  | The dashboard would be unable to function without the Twitter API as its data source. | Low | High | Medium | A few hours of data will be recorded in the format that Twitter provides so that if they decide to disable access then the dashboard can still function from stored data. |
| Twitter changes their API methods  | A substantial amount of connection code may have to be rewritten to use the new methods. | Low | Medium | Medium | The application will be written using a library that has been written to handle connection to Twitter (tweepy python library), if twitter updates their API methods then Tweepy should be updated quickly as there are many programs using this library. |
| Twitter changes their API response format  | A substantial amount of code may have to be rewritten to accomodate the changes. | Low | Medium | Medium | The application will be created as multiple modular sections using APIs to connect them together so that if one part is required to be rewritten the changes will be contained to a single section of the code base rather than having to rewrite code in all / the majority of files. |
| Tweepy stops updating their repository and the library stops fuctioning correctly.  | Either a different python Twitter library would have to be implemented or the Twitter connection would have to be managed manually. | Low | Low | Low | As the library is already downloaded (and is stored in this github repository) unless Twitter also changed their API the current files would still be usable. A backup of this repository will be kept (by both me and Github) to ensure that any files do not get lost. |
| ChartJS stops updating their repository and the library stops fuctioning correctly.  | Either a different JavaScript graphing library would have to be implemented or the visualisations would have to be created manually. | Low | Medium | Medium | As the library is already downloaded (and is stored in this github repository) the current files would still be usable. A backup of this repository will be kept (by both me and Github) to ensure that any files do not get lost. |
| JQuery stops updating their repository and the library stops fuctioning correctly.  | The application would have to be implemented using vanilla JavaScript. | Very Low | Medium | Low | The library is extremely popular so this is highly unlikely. As the library is already downloaded (and is stored in this github repository) the current files may still be usable. A backup of this repository will be kept (by both me and Github) to ensure that any files do not get lost. |
| My development machine breaks and all data is unrecoverable.  | All data would be lost, and I may be unable to work on the project until I was able to purchase a new computer. | Low | High | Medium | All files for this project are stored on Github and/or Dropbox (excluding the database created by the application). The only work that would be lost is work that has not been committed, which are normally at most one hour intervals. I would be able to get hold of a new computer to work on within a maximum of 72 hours, so at most three days would be lost. Though it is likely that some progress could be made without the use of a computer (designing a soon to be implemented part of the project). |
